abstract = {Using the Sea Around Us global catch and effort databases (www.seaaroundus.org), this study presents time series estimates (1950–2016) of total CO2 emissions and emissions intensity (CO2 emissions per unit of catch) from the combustion of fuel in global marine fisheries by fishing sector, as well as a regional comparison of fuel use intensity for 2011. In 2016, total CO2 emissions of the industrial fishing sector were 159 million tonnes compared to 39 million tonnes in 1950. In contrast, the small-scale fishing sector emitted 48 million tonnes in 2016, compared to only 8 million tonnes in1950. Industrial CO2 emissions intensity was estimated to be 2.0 tCO2∙tcatch−1 in 2016 compared to 1.8 tCO2∙tcatch−1 for the small-scale sector in the same year. A previous study, using different methods, estimated global CO2 emissions from fishing to be 112 million tonnes in 2011. Geographical comparisons suggest that the differences between global estimates are explained by regional variation in fuel use intensity and the inclusion of unreported catch and effort data in our estimate. Supplementing fuel use intensity data for one region to that of another with considerably different fisheries may result in misrepresenting fuel use intensity and subsequently CO2 emissions. Our analysis provides insights into changing trends in CO2 emissions from marine fishing and highlights the potential importance of this industry as part of global CO2 reduction strategies.}

It hosts diverse ecosystems and important fisheries that support industry and provide livelihood to coastal settlements. It is also the site of interests and problems, and an intense interaction among managers, producers, and conservationists. In this report, we scrutinize the abiotic (hydrography, climate, ocean circulation, and chemistry) and biotic (phyto- and zooplankton, fish, invertebrates, marine mammals, birds, and turtles) components of the marine ecosystem, and some particular aspects of climate variability, endemisms, harmful algal blooms, oxygen minimum layer, and pollution. We also review the current conditions and conflicts around the main fisheries (shrimp, small and large pelagic fishes, squid, artisanal and sportfishing), the most important human activity in the Gulf of California. We cover some aspects of management and conservation of fisheries, especially the claimed overexploitation of fish resources and the ecosystems, and review proposals for creating networks of marine protected areas. We conclude by identifying main needs for information and research, particularly the integration of data bases, the implementation of models and paleoreconstructions, establishment of monitoring programs, and the evaluation of fishing impacts and management actions.}

abstract = {The Pacific shrimp fishery is the most economically important and ecologically impactful fishery in Mexico. Strong export markets have had a tremendous influence on the technological development and structure of this fishery. This article describes the historical development, current status, ecological impacts and management of the open ocean trawling component of the shrimp fishery in the Sonoran waters of the Gulf of California. We trace the economic factors influencing the development of the Mexican Pacific trawler-based shrimp fishery, with a focus on the port of Guaymas, Sonora, and summarize the events leading to the current overcapitalized and inefficient state of that fishery. The Sonoran shrimp fishery is characterized by high rates of by-catch and a decline in catch per boat trends. A review of economic factors indicates that the decision-making process in this fishery is driven by export markets and does not adequately consider the local ecosystems and fishing communities impacted by shrimp trawling. Management priorities for the fishery include fleet size reduction, habitat protection and alternative technology development. Successful management depends on the participation of powerful export–import companies, along side producers, government resource management agencies, NGOs and scientists. This paper describes recent efforts in collaborative management and calls for the expansion of these efforts.}

abstract = {A three-dimensional numerical model is used to study seasonal connectivity in the Gulf of California. From the Eulerian velocity fields of the model, particle trajectories were calculated for the 12 months of the year using an advection/diffusion scheme. Connectivity was quantified for twelve Gulf provinces with different dynamic/circulation characteristics being defined by the Eulerian velocity field: strong or weak coastal currents, eddies, and areas of mixing and exchange. Retention occurred for 9–12 months of the year in the Upper Gulf, Eddy and Sonora regions of the northern Gulf because of the Gulf-wide eddy circulation, which implies high potential for the auto-recruitment of larvae in this province. High retention was also found on the peninsula side of the southern Gulf in association with weaker residual currents, again implying potential for self-recruitment. In contrast, low retention was observed on the mainland side of the central and southern Gulf, from which particles are exported to many areas by the faster residual currents enhancing the potential for recruitment of distant coastal species. Empirical Orthogonal Function analyses revealed a strong annual and semiannual evolution in accordance with the strong seasonality of the Gulf dynamics.}
