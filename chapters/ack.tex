A special thanks to my supervisor Dr Santiago Suarez de la Fuente. He was always very insightful and visionary about the field, but he was also very detail-oriented and understood the nature of the issues very well. More importantly, Dr Suarez de la Fuente is an extremely caring and supportive mentor. He always gave positive feedback in each weekly meeting, and I couldn't ask for more.

Finally, I want to thank other academic colleagues inside and outside UCL, my fellow schoolmates, family and friends. Without them, this project would not be finished smoothly: Andrea Grech La Rosa, UCL Research Computing, Edward Gryspeerdt, Tom Lutherborrow, Jeff Jinfeng Guo, Mia Stieglitz-Courtney, Shiyi, Hao, Ju, and Shunying.
